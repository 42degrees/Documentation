This tutorial walks you through the necessary steps to integrate IdentityServer in a JS application.  
Since all the steps will be done on the client side, we'll use a JS library, [oidc-token-manager](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-token-manager) to help with tasks like getting and validating tokens.

We'll split the walkthrough in 3 parts:

 - Authenticate against IdentityServer in the JS application
 - Make API calls from the JS application
 - Have a look at how to renew tokens and check sessions

# Part 1 - Authentication against IdentityServer
This first part will focus on allowing us to authenticate in the JS application.

## Create the JS application project
In Visual Studio, create an empty web application and set authentication to "No authentication".

![create js app](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6102639/12247759/9563a71a-b909-11e5-9823-6ba598b74bad.png)

Note the URL assigned to the project:

![js app url](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6102639/12247822/d8345594-b909-11e5-81bd-ff548288280b.png)


## Create the IdentityServer project
In Visual Studio, create an empty web application and set authentication to "No authentication".

![create web app](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6102639/12247585/bd0e33e4-b908-11e5-90bb-b6f3e9b2c060.png)

You can switch the project now to SSL using the properties window:

**Important**
Don't forget to update the start URL in your project properties so that it reflects the HTTPS url of the project.

## Adding IdentityServer
IdentityServer is based on OWIN/Katana and distributed as a NuGet package. To add it to the newly created web host, install the following two packages:

````
Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Host.Systemweb
Install-Package IdentityServer3
````

## Configuring IdentityServer - Clients
IdentityServer needs some information about the clients it is going to support, this can be simply supplied using a `Client` object:

```csharp
public static IEnumerable<Client> Get()
{
    return new[]
    {
        new Client
        {
            Enabled = true,
            ClientName = "JS Client",
            ClientId = "js",
            Flow = Flows.Implicit,

            RedirectUris = new List<string>
            {
                "http://localhost:56668/popup.html"
            },

            AllowedCorsOrigins = new List<string>
            {
                "http://localhost:56668"
            },

            AllowAccessToAllScopes = true
        }
    };
}
```

A special setting here is the `AllowedCorsOrigins` property. This allows IdentityServer to only accept requests from registered URLs. More on the `popup.html` later.

**Remark** Right now the client has access to all scopes (via the `AllowAccessToAllScopes` setting). For production applications you would lock that down.

## Configuring IdentityServer - Users
Next we will add some users to IdentityServer - again this can be accomplished by providing a simple C# class. You can retrieve user information from any data store and we provide out of the box support for ASP.NET Identity and MembershipReboot.

```csharp
public static class Users
{
    public static List<InMemoryUser> Get()
    {
        return new List<InMemoryUser>
        {
            new InMemoryUser
            {
                Username = "bob",
                Password = "secret",
                Subject = "1",

                Claims = new[]
                {
                    new Claim(Constants.ClaimTypes.GivenName, "Bob"),
                    new Claim(Constants.ClaimTypes.FamilyName, "Smith"),
                    new Claim(Constants.ClaimTypes.Email, "bob.smith@email.com")
                }
            }
        };
    }
}
```

## Configuring IdentityServer - Scopes
Finally we will add scopes to IdentityServer. For authentication we'll only put standard IODC scopes. When we'll integrate API calls we'll create our own.

```csharp
public static class Scopes
{
    public static List<Scope> Get()
    {
        return new List<Scope>
        {
            StandardScopes.OpenId,
            StandardScopes.Profile,
            StandarsSc
        };
    }
}
```

## Adding Startup
IdentityServer is configured in the startup class. Here we provide information about the clients, users, scopes,
the signing certificate and some other configuration options.
In production you should load the signing certificate from the Windows certificate store or some other secured source.
In this sample we simply added it to the project as a file (you can download a test certificate from [here](https://github.com/identityserver/Thinktecture.IdentityServer3.Samples/tree/master/source/Certificates).
Add it to the project and set its build action to `Copy to output`.


For info on how to load the certificate from Azure WebSites see [here](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/10/27/using-certificates-in-azure-websites-applications/).

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseIdentityServer(new IdentityServerOptions
        {
            SiteName = "Embedded IdentityServer",
            SigningCertificate = LoadCertificate(),

            Factory = new IdentityServerServiceFactory()
                .UseInMemoryUsers(Users.Get())
                .UseInMemoryClients(Clients.Get())
                .UseInMemoryScopes(Scopes.Get())
        });
    }

    X509Certificate2 LoadCertificate()
    {
        return new X509Certificate2(
            Path.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, @"bin\Config\idsrv3test.pfx"), "idsrv3test");
    }
}
```

At this point you have a fully functional IdentityServer and you can browse to the discovery endpoint to inspect the configuration:


![disco](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6102639/12248608/a3f8281e-b90e-11e5-88a0-bb267e5d253a.png)

## RAMMFAR
One last thing, please don't forget to add RAMMFAR to your web.config, otherwise some of our embedded assets will not be loaded correctly by IIS:

```xml
<system.webServer>
  <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true" />
</system.webServer>
```

## JS Client - setup

We use several third-party libraries to support our application:

 - [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download/)
 - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download)
 - [oidc-token-manager](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-token-manager)

and put them in the `content` folder:

![content folder](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6102639/12249132/e180dee4-b911-11e5-8f0b-41072202768c.png)

We also create a basic `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JS Application</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="content/css/bootstrap.css" />
    <style>
        .main-container {
            padding-top: 70px;
        }

        pre:empty {
            display: none;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="navbar-header">
                <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">JS Application</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </nav>

    <div class="container main-container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <ul class="list-inline list-unstyled requests">
                    <li><a href="index.html" class="btn btn-primary">Home</a></li>
                    <li><button type="button" class="btn btn-default js-login">Login</button></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <div class="panel panel-default">
                    <div class="panel-heading">ID Token Contents</div>
                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <pre class="js-id-token"></pre>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script src="content/js/jquery-2.1.4.js"></script>
    <script src="content/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
    <script src="content/js/oidc.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

and a `popup.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title></title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
    <script src="content/js/oidc.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

We have two HTML files because `oidc-token-manager` can open a popup to show the login form to the user.

## JS Client - authentication

Now that we have everything we need, we can configure our login settings in `index.html` thanks to the `OidcTokenManager` JS class.

```js
function display(selector, data) {
    if (data && typeof data === 'string') {
        data = JSON.parse(data);
    }
    if (data) {
        data = JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);
    }

    $(selector).text(data);
}

var settings = {
    authority: 'https://localhost:44300',
    client_id: 'js',
    popup_redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:56668/popup.html',

    response_type: 'id_token',
    scope: 'openid profile',

    // this will allow all the OIDC protocol claims to be visible in the window. normally a client app
    // wouldn't care about them or want them taking up space
    filter_protocol_claims: true
};

var manager = new OidcTokenManager(settings);

$('.js-login').click(function () {
    manager.openPopupForTokenAsync()
        .then(function () {
            display('.js-id-token', manager.profile);
        }, function (error) {
            console.error(error);
        });
});
```

Let's go quickly through the settings:

 - `authority` is the base URL of our IdentityServer instance. This will allow oidc-token-manager to query the metadata endpoint so it can validate the tokens
 - `client_id` is the id of the client we want to use when hitting the authorization endpoint
 - `popup_redirect_uri` is the redirect URL used when using the `openPopupForTokenAsync` method. If you prefer not having a popup and redirecting the user in the main window, you can use the `redirect_uri` property and the `redirectForTokenAsync` method
 - `response_type` defines in our case that we only expect an identity token back
 - `scope` defines the scopes the application asks for
 - `filter_protocol_claims` instructs oidc-token-manager if it has to filter some OIDC protocol claims from the response: `nonce`, `at_hash`, `iat`, `nbf`, `exp`, `aud`, `iss` and `idp`

We also have to configure `popup.html`:

```js
var manager = new OidcTokenManager();
manager.processTokenPopup();
```

Under the hoods, the instance of `OidcTokenManager` of `index.html` redirects the popup to the login page. When IdentityServer redirects the user to the popup page, the information is then passed back to the main page.
Also note that the method used to open the popup and login returns promises, which is why we use `then`. A lot of methods of oidc-token-manager use this pattern.

At this stage, you can login:

![login-popup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6102639/12250630/94dce974-b91c-11e5-8077-dabcf88d80e5.png)

![login-complete](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6102639/12250642/a703c0aa-b91c-11e5-9e3f-2b2b70b10e5b.png)

You can try and set the `filter_protocol_claims` property to `false` and see the additional claims being stored in the `profile` property.

## JS application - scopes

Remember we configured our user with an `email` claim? It doesn't show up in the identity token because the scopes the client asked for - `openid` and `profile` - don't contain this claim.
If you want to get the user's email, you'll have to ask for another scope which is called `email` by editing the `scopes` property of the `OidcTokenManager` settings.

In our case, the only modification we need to make is to let IdentityServer know that this scope exists in the `Scopes` class:

```csharp
public static class Scopes
{
    public static List<Scope> Get()
    {
        return new List<Scope>
        {
            StandardScopes.OpenId,
            StandardScopes.Profile,
            StandardScopes.Email
        };
    }
}
```

We don't have to change anything in the client configuration because we specified it has access to all the scopes. In a realistic scenario, you want to give a client access to only the scopes it's expected to request, so this would require a change in the client configuration as well.

After this, we can see the `email` claim in the identity token:
